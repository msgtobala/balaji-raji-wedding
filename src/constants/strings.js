arrow from the cupid's bow and I realized she was the one when I met her. My whole life has changed forever and her love made me who I am today. One life, thousands of months, 
millions of days, billions of hours, trillions of seconds with her makes my life complete.`;

about him, he suddenly appeared with a bouquet (romantic right!) and I starred him for few seconds astonishingly. I still remember the feeling I felt when I first started talking to him.
Finally, this lovely journey started with him which lasts for a lifetime.`;
